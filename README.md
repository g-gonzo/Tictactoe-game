## Tic-Tac-Toe
There are many tutorials out there using games as project. Tic-Tac-Toe is no exception. This example definitely has its origin based on the [React.org] (https://reactjs.org/) version. I was looking to create a react version that used some modules and hooks. I came across a great tutorial by [Shif Ben Avraham] (https://medium.com/@shifrb/about) and pulled in this knowledge as an inspiration for my first React project, along with some stuff I learned along the way.
## Motivation
I am relatively new to coding and trying to learn some React.

node 14.15.5, npm 7.5.3, Create-react-app, Bootstrap v4.5.3, Visual Studio Code 1.54.1
